Mutagen is an audio metadata tag reader and writer implemented in pure Python 3.
It supports reading ID3v1.1, ID3v2.2, ID3v2.3, ID3v2.4, APEv2, and FLAC, and

    * Compatibility with as many other tag readers and editors as possible
    * Compliance with the relevant specifications
    * Written in Pythonic Python, with a Pythonic API
    * Unit and regression test suite
    * Provide access to all features of the supported formats
    * Easily extensible
